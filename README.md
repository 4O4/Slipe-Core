# Slipe-Core (Alpha)

Slipe-Core is a framework that enables anyone to write scripts for [MTA:San Andreas](https://Slipe.MTADefinitions.com/) in C# instead of Lua, wrapping all MTA elements and classes and including some .NET Core namespaces. It is based on [CSharp.lua](https://github.com/yanghuan/CSharp.lua) by [Yang Huan](https://github.com/yanghuan).

To fully enhance your development workflow, use [Slipe-CLI](https://github.com/mta-slipe/Slipe-CLI) to create, build and manage your projects.
